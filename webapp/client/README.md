Introducing... EqualWrites ✍️✍️✍️ removing implicit biases from your writing!

#EqualWritesEqualRights ✍🏻✍🏼✍🏽✍🏾✍🏿
 
Problem:
 
Implicit biases in language and writing results in unequal opportunities in hiring.
 
From job listings to recommendation letters, these biases have been shown to impact hiring decision
 
Gendered words, racialized terms, and ableist language contribute to sustained inequality.
 
Studies show that gendered/racialized wording in job postings lead to fewer female and minority applicants. They also show that recommendation letters with “feminine” words imply a less qualified applicant in the eyes of recruiters.
 
These biases reinforce workplace inequality, placing female and marginalized applicants at an disadvantage in the job market.
 
Our solution:
 
Using the power of our algorithms running research-backed data, EqualWrites returns an analysis of your writing, and provides feedback to improve the accessibility of what you write!!!

Version 1.0

See % words that are classified as masculine/feminine/racially/ableist leaning.

What's on the horizon:

Dynamic Improvements -> text identified as problematic will be highlighted, with replacement suggestions 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
Better Identification -> use machine learning to adapt our algorithms over time 💪💪💪
